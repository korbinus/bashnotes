# bashnotes

## Introduction

In today's digital age, many people turn to popular tools like Evernote, Notion, and others for managing their personal knowledge. While these tools offer convenience and a wide range of features, they often fall short in helping users build a true second brain. The main issues with these tools are:

1. **Lack of Structure**: They encourage dumping information without proper organization, leading to clutter and difficulty in retrieval.
2. **Passive Consumption**: Users tend to collect information without processing or internalizing it, resulting in knowledge that remains superficial.
3. **Overwhelm**: The sheer volume of features and possibilities can be paralyzing, making it hard to maintain a consistent practice.
4. **Remote Dependency**: These tools often rely on cloud services, creating dependency on external platforms with potential privacy concerns.

This system addresses these issues by implementing the **Domain-Note-Reflection-Summary (DNRS)** model, which promotes active engagement with information and structured knowledge building. 

Unlike cloud-based solutions, Bashnote operates only locally, giving you full control over your data while maintaining simplicity and effectiveness.

## Domain-Note-Reflection-Summary Model

The DNRS model is designed to help you process and internalize information effectively. Here's how it works:

1. **Domains**: Broad categories that represent areas of interest or expertise.
2. **Notes**: Individual pieces of information, ideas, or insights related to a specific domain.
3. **Reflections**: Reflections about a subject or within a domain.
4. **Summaries**: Summaries or synthesis of notes about a subject or within a domain.

This model ensures that you actively engage with your knowledge, transforming raw information into meaningful insights.


## Getting Started

### Requirements

To use this system effectively, you'll need:

1. A Unix-like shell environment with Bash:
   - Linux (any distribution)
   - macOS
   - Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) on Windows 10/11

2. A text editor of your choice:
   - **Recommended**: Visual Studio Code or VSCodium (lightweight, open-source alternative to VS Code)
     - Install from [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [vscodium.com](https://vscodium.com/)
   - Other options: Nano, Vim, Emacs

3. Basic command line familiarity:
   - Navigating directories
   - Running shell scripts

### Download Bashnotes

Dowload Bashnotes from [Github](https://github.com/korbinus/bashnotes), either by downloading a zip file or by cloning the repository:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/korbinus/bashnotes.git
```

Move then to the directory bashnotes:
```bash
$ cd bashnotes
```


### Configuration

Before using the system, you can customize it by editing the `config.txt` file in your bashnote directory:

```ini
# Folder names configuration (change these to your preference)
notes_folder=1_notes
reflections_folder=2_reflections
summaries_folder=3_summaries

# Editor configuration (recommended: vscode or codium)
editor=vscode  # Options: vscode, codium, nano, vim, emacs...
```

### Creating a New Domain

To create a new domain:

```bash
$ new/domain.sh <Domain name>
```

This will automatically:
1. Create a new folder named after your domain (e.g., `Programming`, `Health`)
2. Set up the basic directory structure with subfolders for notes, reflections, and summaries
3. Create a `refs` directory for storing reference documents

The created directory structure will look like this:
```
<Domain name>/
├── 1_notes/          # Notes folder (customizable in config.txt)
├── 2_reflections/    # Reflections folder (customizable)
├── 3_summaries/      # Summaries folder (customizable)
└── refs/             # For storing reference documents
```

You might initially name your first domain **General** until you think of more specific alternatives.

### Creating a New Note

To create a new note from the bashnote directory:

```bash
$ new/note.sh <Domain name> <Note title>
```

This will:
1. Create a new markdown file in the appropriate domain's notes folder
2. Open the file in your configured text editor (default: VS Code)

### Creating a New Reflection

To create a new reflection from the bashnote directory:

```bash
$ new/reflection.sh <Domain name> <Reflection title>
```

This will:
1. Create a new markdown file in the appropriate domain's reflections folder
2. Open the file in your configured text editor

### Creating a New Summary

To create a new summary from the bashnote directory:

```bash
$ new/summary.sh <Domain name> <Summary title>
```

This will:
1. Create or update a markdown file in the appropriate domain's summaries folder
2. Open the file in your configured text editor

## Managing Tags

### Adding Tags to Your Content

Tags help you organize and retrieve information more effectively:

1. After creating a note, reflection, or summary, open the generated markdown file
2. Add tags at the top of the file using this format:
   ```markdown
   tags: #tag1 #tag2 #tag3
   ```

### Creating Tag Indexes

To create an index of all your tags with links to corresponding notes:

```bash
$ new/tags.sh
```

This command will:
1. Scan all your domains for tagged content
2. Create a `tags` directory in your root folder if it doesn't exist
3. Generate a markdown file for each tag containing links to all notes that use that tag

The generated structure will look like this:
```
tags/
├── tag1.md       
├── tag2.md       
└── ...
```

Each tag file will contain:
- The tag name as a header
- A list of all notes using that tag with relative paths
- Links to each note for easy navigation

> **NOTE** You'll need to run it as often as necessary

## File Structure Example

Here's what your complete knowledge base might look like:

```
knowledge_base/
├── config.txt            # Configuration file
├── tags/                 # Auto-generated tag indexes
│   ├── programming.md
│   └── research.md
└── domains/
    ├── Programming/
    │   ├── 1_notes/
    │   │   ├── 2023-07-15_algorithm_concepts.md
    │   │   └── ...
    │   ├── 2_reflections/
    │   │   ├── 2023-08-01_code_review_thoughts.md
    │   │   └── ...
    │   ├── 3_summaries/
    │   │   └── programming_summary_2023.md
    │   └── refs/
    │       ├── design_patterns.pdf
    │       └── ...
    └── Health/
        ├── 1_notes/
        │   ├── 2023-07-20_nutrition_tips.md
        │   └── ...
        ├── 2_reflections/
        │   └── ...
        ├── 3_summaries/
        │   └── health_summary_2023.md
        └── refs/
            └── ...
```

### Backup
You can simply backup your data by copying the ```bashnotes```directory (or even only ```domains```) in a safe place. 

### Mobile availability

You can copy your files into you mobile device using for instance ```localsend``` if you absolutely need your bashnotes with you. 
Don't forget to install a markdown reader app on your mobile device!
